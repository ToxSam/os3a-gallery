# Asset Collections

Welcome to the Asset Collections section! This site showcases 3D asset collections with clear licenses and sources, all designed to be free and easy to use in your projects.

## Overview

Open Source 3D Assets features curated collections from talented creators. Our primary source is the [open-source-3D-assets](https://github.com/ToxSam/open-source-3D-assets) repository, which includes Polygonal Mind collections and more.

## Collection Types

- **Polygonal Mind Collections**: 17 themed collections (MomusPark, Medieval Fair, Tomb Chaser, Chromatic Chaos, Crystal Crossroads, and more) with 991+ GLB assets
- **Other creators**: Additional CC0 and open-license 3D collections may be added over time

## Licensing

Most collections use **CC0 (Public Domain)** licensing, meaning you can use them however you want without attribution. Some collections may use **CC-BY**, which requires attribution but still allows commercial use. Check each collection's details for specific licensing information.

## Format

Assets are provided as **GLB** (binary glTF) files, compatible with Blender, Unity, Unreal Engine, Three.js, and most 3D tools.

## Finding Collections

- Use the [Asset Browser](/en/finder) to search and filter by collection
- Each collection page shows license, asset count, and download options
- Metadata is available as JSON from the [Asset Database](/en/resources/developers/database) for integration into your own apps

> **Note:** The list of collections is driven by the [open-source-3D-assets](https://github.com/ToxSam/open-source-3D-assets) repository (`data/projects.json`).
