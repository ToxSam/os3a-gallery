# About GLB Format

GLB is the binary form of glTF (GL Transmission Format), a royalty-free 3D asset format designed for efficient transmission and loading. It's the standard for 3D models on the web and in real-time applications.

## Why we use GLB

- **Wide compatibility** – Works in Blender, Unity, Unreal Engine, Three.js, and most 3D tools
- **Open standard** – Khronos Group standard, not tied to any single vendor
- **Single-file** – Model, materials, and (optionally) textures in one file
- **Efficient** – Binary format is compact and fast to load
- **Web-friendly** – Native support in browsers via WebGL and frameworks like Three.js

## Compatible with

- **Blender** – Native import/export
- **Unity** – Built-in GLTFUtility or other importer packages
- **Unreal Engine** – glTF/GLB import support
- **Three.js / Web** – GLTFLoader (and our viewer uses it)
- **Godot, Babylon.js, and more** – Broad ecosystem support
