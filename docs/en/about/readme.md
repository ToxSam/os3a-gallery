# About

Learn about the technologies and philosophy behind Open Source 3D Assets.

## Our Mission

Open Source 3D Assets is dedicated to making it easy to discover free, high-quality 3D assets for games, VR, and creative projects. We believe in open standards, clear licensing, and community-driven content.

## Technologies We Use

We use formats and tooling that work everywhere:

- **GLB Format**: The standard 3D asset format (binary glTF) – works in Blender, Unity, Unreal, Three.js, and more
- **GitHub**: Asset metadata and registry in the open-source-3D-assets repository
- **Open Standards**: Open formats and standards, not proprietary solutions

## Our Philosophy

We're committed to open source principles. Most of the assets we list use CC0 (Public Domain) licensing, meaning you can use them however you want without attribution. Some collections use CC-BY, which requires attribution but still allows commercial use.
