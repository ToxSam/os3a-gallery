# For Developers

Welcome to the developer resources section! Here you'll find everything you need to integrate Open Source 3D Assets into your projects, access our data, and contribute to the ecosystem.

## Overview

Open Source 3D Assets provides a registry of 3D asset collections (GLB format) that you can use in games, VR experiences, and creative projects. All metadata is available as JSON from our GitHub repository.

## What's Available

- **Asset Database**: JSON files with collection and asset metadata, file URLs, and license info
- **Gallery Source Code**: Open source codebase for this website (os3a-gallery)
- **Documentation**: Guides and structure for integration

## Getting Started

Explore the [Asset Database](/en/resources/developers/database) structure and the [open-source-3D-assets](https://github.com/ToxSam/open-source-3D-assets) repository. Use the JSON data to build your own browser, tooling, or integrations.
